- Register Forwarding
	- Make lock_count an array of bitmaps, which show where it is locked by
	- Instead of stalling on a set lock, instead switch rsX to use the value provided by that stage
	- Find the correct stage by getting the least significant set bit of the bitmap at index X

- Branch Flushing
	- Flush (Stage): The input to the **next** must be set to a NOP
	- Flushes should be unset after the flush has occured.
	- Flushes take precedence over stalls

- Exceptions
	- Set ecode to the code
	- When ecode is detected to have been set
		- Flush and stall all previous pipeline stages.
		- epc = PC + 4
		- In fetch loop:
			- PC = evec + (ecode * 4) 

	- Exceptions to implement:
		- Invalid Instruction
		- Instruction Misalign
